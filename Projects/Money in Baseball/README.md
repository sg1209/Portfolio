# Money in Baseball

## Project Overview

- Motivated by Shohei Ohtani's historical contract with LA Dodgers, research and analysis about the relationship between player payroll and winning rate was conducted. Additionally, whether Shohei's contract is reasonable based on performance statistics was evaluated.

## Key Actions and Techniques

### Data Collection and Preparation:

- Sourced MLB team statistics data from Kaggle.

- Real time player performance data was collected through web-scraping.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Performed EDA to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

- Identified key variables and relationships influencing winning ratings and player payrolls by seasons.

### Insights and Analysis:

- Discovered a meaningful insights about factors making teams cost-effective.

- Analyzed whether Shohei Ohtani's contract is reasonable based on WAR/WAA and cost per win.

### Visualization and Communication:

- Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings.

- Created a presentation and a report to deliver insights.

### Tools and Technologies

- R: Data analysis and manipulation.

- tidyverse: Data wrangling and aggregation.

- ggplot2: Data visualization.

- Statistical Analysis: Identifying and analyzing key relationships.

### Project Outcomes

- This analysis provides valuable insights into contemporary investment trends in baseball. While there is a general trend suggesting that teams spending more money are more likely to achieve better results, the correlation between spending and winning is not perfect. Although this controversy cannot be simply answered, the analysis results offer sufficient and valuable evidence for further analysis to manage teams cost-effectively by focusing on defensive aspects of player performance.
  
- Moreover, while investing a massive amount of money in a star player is not always the answer for the best outcome, the analysis of Shohei Ohtaniâ€™s historical contract demonstrates that his contract is reasonable when considering the additional cost per win compared to other All-Star level players.Given that professional baseball teams are enterprises, considering the potential income Shohei can bring to the team provides exceptional and additional evidence to support the claim that the contract is rational within the current trend in baseball regarding star players.
