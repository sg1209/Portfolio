# MLB Performance Prediction (1969-2022)
## Project Overview
Predicted MLB battersâ€™ performance for the 2023 season by analyzing historical batting data from 1969 to 2022.

## Key Actions and Techniques
### Data Aggregation and Cleaning:

- Combined and cleaned three datasets using the tidyverse package in R.

- Ensured data integrity and consistency for accurate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Conducted thorough data exploration to identify significant variables.

- Visualized trends and patterns using ggplot2.

### Model Development:

- Developed regression models for three key performance metrics: Batting Average (BA), Isolated Discipline (IsoD), and Isolated Power (IsoP).

- Applied various regression methods to find the best-fitting models.

### Prediction and Evaluation:

- Used the established models to predict player performance for the 2023 season.

- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

### Communication:

- Presented findings and insights to stakeholders through a detailed presentation.
- Composed a comprehensive project report documenting methodology, progress, and predictions.

## Tools and Technologies

- R: Data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

- tidyverse: Data wrangling and aggregation.

- ggplot2: Data visualization.

- Regression Techniques: Various methods including linear regression, ridge regression, RandomForest, XgBoost, and more.

## Project Outcomes
- Successfully predicted MLB batters' performance for the upcoming season.

- Gained insights into key factors influencing batting performance.

- Demonstrated strong analytical and modeling skills using R.
