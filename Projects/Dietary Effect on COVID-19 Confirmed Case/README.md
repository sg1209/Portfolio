# Dietary Effect on COVID-19 Confirmed Cases

## Project Overview

- Analyzed the relationship between national diets and COVID-19 infection rates using dietary and COVID-19 data from various countries.

## Key Actions and Techniques

### Data Collection and Preparation:

- Gathered and integrated dietary data and COVID-19 infection data from multiple sources.

- Ensured data quality and consistency for accurate analysis.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Conducted EDA to identify key dietary factors and patterns.

- Formulated research questions based on initial findings.

### Statistical Analysis:

- Applied statistical tests (e.g. ANOVA) to examine the relationship between diet and COVID-19 infection rates.

- Utilized graphical representations to visualize the correlations.

### Model Development:

- Constructed regression models to analyze the impact of different diets on COVID-19 infection rates.

- Identified specific diets that significantly correlate with infection rates.

### Tools and Technologies
- R: Data analysis and manipulation.

- tidyverse: Data wrangling and aggregation.

- ggplot2: Data visualization.

- Statistical Testing: Hypothesis testing to validate findings.

- Regression Analysis: Modeling the relationship between dietary factors and COVID-19 infection rates.

## Project Outcomes
- Identified significant dietary patterns associated with COVID-19 infection rates.

- Provided insights into how certain diets may influence susceptibility to COVID-19.

- Demonstrated the integration of dietary and epidemiological data to draw meaningful conclusions.
