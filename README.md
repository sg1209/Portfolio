Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository is a culmination of my journey in data analytics, showcasing my passion for uncovering insights, solving problems, and making data-driven decisions.

## About

Reflecting on my high school years, the movie 'Moneyball' triggered my fascination with data analytics. Observing the strategic application of statistics and data-driven decision-making, and acknowledging how they promote optimized outcomes, motivated my dedication to the field of data analytics. With a Bachelor's degree in statistics and a Master's degree in Business Analytics at UIUC, I have multiple relevant experiences where I have cultivated my statistical and analytical skills. With a belief that data serves as a window to the world, I am deeply passionate and seeking opportunities to apply my skills to various business problems, providing effective solutions and contributing to elevate successes.
